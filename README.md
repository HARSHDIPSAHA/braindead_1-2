## Overview  
This repository showcases our solutions to two distinct data science challenges:  

- **Cricket analytics** with predictive modeling for IPL 2025  
- **Scientific paper summarization** using hybrid NLP techniques  

## Problem Statement 1: IPL Data Analysis  
An extensive analysis of IPL data (2008-2024) to uncover insights and predict the 2025 IPL winner. The project includes:  

- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis of team and player performance  
- Feature engineering and extraction  
- Ensemble model development for winner prediction  
- Visualization of key metrics and trends  

## Problem Statement 2: Research Article Summarization  
A hybrid extractive-abstractive model for summarizing scientific research papers. Key features include:  

- Processing of multiple research article datasets (**CompScholar, ArXiv, PubMed**)  
- Token length reduction (**95%+ reduction across datasets**)  
- Vocabulary optimization (**10-16% reduction in size, 50%+ improvement in OOV rates**)  
- Data quality enhancement (**elimination of null values and duplicates**)  
- LED-based architecture for long document summarization
